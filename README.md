# dash-hue-light-control
This module let you control your light with Amazon dash button.

## Contents

 * [Installation](https://github.com/mbret/dash-hue-light-control#installation)
 
## Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/mbret/dash-hue-light-control.git`
- `cd dash-hue-light-control`
- `npm install`

## How to run it
Just create a `settings.json` somewhere. Then navigate to the module folder and run:

`sudo node index --settings=path/to/settings.json`

The process will keep watching for your dash press action and control the light.

## settings.json sample
```json
{
  "jwt": "FkXIos6bRxzyy54qsspHLa2MGx5-IQkWNLfIbn4",
  "bridge": "192.168.0.10",
  "dash": "b4:7c:9c:49:b4:d4",
  "lightId": "2",
  "mode": "toggle"
}
```
The available modes are:

- `toggle`
- `on`
- `off`

The toggle mode will either turn on or off your light depending on its current state.

## Run it as a background process
In the real world you probably want to run this program as a background process and let it run forever.
An easy way to do it is to download [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) or other process manager and
run the command `sudo node index --settings=path/to/settings.json` through this process manager. Refer to the
dedicated doc for more info.

Here is an example with pm2:
- `npm install pm2 -g`
- `pm2 start /path/to/dash-hue-light-control/index.js --name="my-dash-control" -- --settings=/path/to/settings.json`

Note that you will probably need to run this as sudo as well because of PcapSession

## Note about dash button
Due to how the button is designed (sleep, wake up, connect to wifi, arp, sleep, ...) there is a noticeable timeout between a press and its action. I cannot do anything about
that and remember that this is a 2â‚¬ smart button after all.
